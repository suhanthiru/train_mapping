# Nightly Build Log

Autonomous overnight build of the Live 3D Transit Tracker (see [PROJECT_SPEC.md](PROJECT_SPEC.md)).
Mode: continuous through phases, skip-and-note on hard blockers, git commit at each milestone.

## Environment (verified before sleep)
- Portable Node **v24.18.0** LTS + npm 11.16.0 at `.tools/node-v24.18.0-win-x64` (not on system PATH — prepend it in shell calls).
- `node:sqlite` built-in available → no native build (avoids better-sqlite3 / node-gyp risk).
- Python 3.11.9, git 2.54 present.
- Network OK. Confirmed reachable: live MTA feed (200, ~57KB), NYC static GTFS zip (200, 5.6MB), npm registry (200).
- NYC needs **no API key**. MARTA + Paris keys needed later (Phases 4) — will block those, not Phase 1.

## Cannot be done overnight (needs you)
- Deployment (Oracle VM + Cloudflare) — requires your interactive cloud logins.
- MARTA / Paris feeds — need free API keys/tokens from you.

## Progress
- [in progress] Phase 1 setup: repo scaffold, toolchain, configs.

## Blockers encountered
_(none yet)_
